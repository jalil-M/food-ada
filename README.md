## Installation and testing

1. Install Jekyll ([detailed steps](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)).
2. Inside `blog/`, run `jekyll serve --watch`. This will start a local development server accessible at [`http://127.0.0.1:4000`](http://127.0.0.1:4000). It will also listen to file changes and will update the webpages accordingly.
